# Testing Vagrant for Base Development Environments

This repo heavily inspired by [Osteel](https://github.com/osteel)'s [blog post](http://blog.osteel.me/posts/2015/01/25/how-to-use-vagrant-for-local-web-development.html) on the topic. We're using vagrant as a quicky and dirty and easy way to spin up VMs with different predefined conditions. This was the first repo in which we tried to use it. The overall work is going great, but this repo isn't totally essential. 

# Notes

- [nginx wiki](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/) is an amazing resource for a powerful and FAST webserver, particularly their [Example Config and Recipes](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/#pre-canned-configurations) section. Highly recommended.
